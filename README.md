## Result

The task was to analyze district-wide standardized test results and provide insights to the school board and mayor for making strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. The analysis was conducted using Python and the provided data on different schools and their corresponding test results.

The analysis has revealed the following conclusions:
- Charter schools have a higher overall passing rate (90.4%) than District schools (53.7%);
- Schools that are small to medium have a higher overall passing rate (89.9 – 90.6%) than large-sized schools (58.3%);
- Schools with a lower spending budget per student (< USD 585 – 630) have a higher overall passing rate (81.4 – 90.4%) than schools with a higher spending budget per student (53.5 – 62.9%).

These findings suggest that the school board and mayor should consider allocating more resources to smaller schools and reducing the spending budget per student in larger schools. Additionally, they should explore the possibility of converting some district schools to charter schools in order to improve overall student performance.
